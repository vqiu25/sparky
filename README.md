## About
A simple 2D space shooter inspired by arcade games such as Asteroids and Galaga, implemented using C++, the graphics library raylib, and CMake for build configuration. It supports an infinite canvas, with enemies spawning periodically targetting the player. The player controls a spaceship, can shoot lasers, and must avoid or destroy enemies to survive.
